# Jinx OS
Jinx is an operating system built from scratch.

I decided to start this project to learn how to make an OS. Hence, this software is **not** intended to be used by end users - at least, not unless it becomes stable and featureful enough for that to be possible.

A small disclaimer, most of the code in this repository has been copied, or at least heavily influenced by, various tutorials. After all, I'm trying to learn the ropes as an operating system developer, and am a complete beginner to this area of software engineering.

## References/Tutorials I Followed
Below, I've listed all of the tutorials that I used to create Jinx OS.
